# Introduction

Dive-packages, a meticulously crafted and versatile toolkit, is your key to unlocking new frontiers in blockchain exploration. Tailored for seamless integration with the Dive CLI, this powerful tool goes beyond the ordinary, offering not only an enhanced experience within Dive CLI but also standing independently as a robust solution. In addition to providing unparalleled flexibility and control in navigating decentralized landscapes, Dive-packages is a time and effort-saving companion, streamlining your journey into the future of blockchain innovation. Dive in and discover the ultimate synergy of efficiency and empowerment with our comprehensive Dive Packages.

## About

Our focus extends beyond mere node creation â€“ Dive-packages is engineered to effortlessly facilitate the establishment of bridges between diverse blockchains. We understand the importance of interconnectedness in the decentralized landscape, and our toolkit ensures that users can effortlessly create bridges without the hassle of navigating complex setup procedures.

## Setup and Requirements

Ensure the following prerequisites are met before using the Dive-package:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Make sure Docker is installed on your machine. You can [install it here](https://www.docker.com/).

- [Kurtosis](https://www.kurtosis.com/): Ensure Kurtosis is installed on your machine. You can [install it here](https://www.kurtosis.com/).

# Integrated Chains

Dive-packages is a robust toolkit designed to cater to a wide range of blockchain enthusiasts and developers, offering seamless support for various chains. The toolkit includes compatibility with **Ethereum (ETH)**, a fundamental blockchain renowned for smart contract execution and decentralized applications. With Dive-packages, users can effortlessly navigate and interact within the Ethereum ecosystem, streamlining their development and exploration process.

Furthermore, Dive-packages extends its reach to incorporate **Hardhat**, a powerful development environment for Ethereum projects. Hardhat integration enhances the toolkit's capabilities, providing developers with advanced testing, debugging, and deployment functionalities, all within a user-friendly environment.

**ICON**, known for its focus on interoperability, is also featured in Dive-packages. By supporting ICON, the toolkit enables users to bridge connections between different blockchains, fostering a more interconnected and collaborative decentralized landscape.

**Neutron**, an innovative blockchain protocol, finds its place within Dive-packages, offering users the opportunity to delve into a dynamic ecosystem with unique features and potential. Whether you are a developer seeking new possibilities or an enthusiast exploring diverse blockchain landscapes, Neutron's support in Dive-packages ensures a seamless and enriching experience.

**Archway**, another integral part of Dive-packages, introduces users to a blockchain with distinctive features, opening avenues for decentralized applications and projects. The toolkit facilitates effortless interaction with Archway, empowering users to explore and harness the capabilities of this innovative blockchain.

# Integrated Bridges

Dive-packages goes beyond merely supporting individual blockchains; it extends its capabilities to facilitate seamless interconnectivity with the inclusion of **Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)** and **Blockchain Transfer Protocol (BTP)** bridges. These bridges serve as instrumental components in the toolkit, empowering users to effortlessly establish connections and foster interoperability between diverse blockchain networks.

**Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)**, a groundbreaking protocol, allows for the secure and trustless transfer of data and assets across different blockchains. Dive-packages integrates IBC bridges, providing users with the tools to create a decentralized network that transcends the boundaries of individual blockchains. This capability enhances collaboration and communication between various decentralized ecosystems.

**Blockchain Transfer Protocol (BTP)** is another key feature within Dive-packages, offering users the ability to establish bridges between different blockchains with simplicity and efficiency. BTP bridges facilitate the smooth transfer of assets and data, promoting a cohesive and interconnected blockchain experience. With Dive-packages, users can harness the power of BTP to create bridges that seamlessly link distinct blockchain networks.

In essence, Dive-packages not only supports an array of individual blockchains, including Ethereum, Hardhat, Neutron, Archway, and ICON but also empowers users to transcend these individual ecosystems through the integration of IBC and BTP bridges. This comprehensive toolkit is designed to provide users with a unified and user-friendly platform, fostering collaboration and innovation across diverse blockchain landscapes.

# Configuration File Guidelines

To use the Dive-packages, you need to create a configuration file specifying the desired network setup. Below is an example configuration file along with explanations for each field: 

**To start an individual node:**

```json
{
    "command": "chain",
    "node_name": "archway"
}
```

**To start a bridge between two nodes:**

```json
{
    "command":"bridge",
    "bridge_type":"btp",
    "chain_a":"icon",
    "chain_b":"icon",
}
```

## Configuration Fields:

- **command:** The action to be performed. 
- **node_name:** The name of the chain to spawn.
- **custom_config:** A dictionary with custom config for spawning the node. If not passed, the node starts with default configuration.
    
    - For ICON, the required fields are:
        - private_port (int): The private port for the node.
        - public_port (int): The public port for the node.
        - p2p_listen_address (str): The p2p listen address.
        - p2p_address (str): The p2p address.
        - cid (str): The CID (Chain ID) of the node.
        - genesis_file_path (str): The file path to the genesis file.
        - genesis_file_name (str): The name of the genesis file.

    - For Cosmos (Archway/Neutron), the required fields are:
        - chain_id (str): The chain ID.
        - key (str): The key.
        - password (str): The password.
        - public_grpc (str): The public gRPC address.
        - public_http (str): The public HTTP address.
